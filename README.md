The App with a swiping mechanism similar to dating apps like Tinder. 

Users can swipe left (dislike) or swipe right (like) on images downloaded from the Unsplash API.

Functuanality: 
- A bunch of random images is downloaded from the Unsplash API.
- When the limit of photos per page is reached - another page is uploaded.
- Users can see one random image on the screen at a time.
- Users are able to swipe left or swipe right on the image.

Extra challenges:
- Swiping animation (Thumbs Up/Down) is displayed when a user interacts with the image.
- Thumb Image transparency changes depending on the swipe gesture distance.
- Swiping the card you rotate it more and more as you get closer to the edge of the screen
- When the swipe gesture distance is not enough - the image won't be changed.
